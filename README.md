## Hi there!


This work is an attempt to predict the manner in which the people did the exercise in the following study.
*Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.*

In the study mentioned above, six participants participated in a dumbell lifting activity five different ways. The five ways, as described in the study, were “exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.”

By processing the data gathered from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of the participants in a machine learning algorithm, can the appropriate activity (class A-E) be predicted?

This report underlines the following task discussed in coursera.
1. How you built your model.
2. How you used cross validation.
3. What you think the expected out of sample error is
4. Why you made the choices you did
